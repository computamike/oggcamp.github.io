Learn about how Configuration Management can be performed in a test-first manner (in these examples) using Chef, in a talk full of food puns. I’ll discuss how investing time into the manner in which your application is deployed is almost as important as the software that is deployed.

He is a GNU/Linux user, a big advocate for the Free Software Movement, and tries to self host his own services where possible, instead of relying on other providers.

Yes, this talk is about running your own mainframe on your own hardware. Mainframes are old, yes, but they are still very much alive. New hardware is still being developed and there are a lot of fresh jobs in this area too. A lot of mainframes run COBOL workloads. COBOL is far from a dead language. It processes an estimated 85% of all business transactions, and 5 billion lines of new COBOL code are written every year. In this session the speaker will help you in take your first steps towards running your own mainframe. If you like then after this session you can continue to build your knowledge of mainframe systems using the links provided during the talk. Come on in and learn the basics of a completely different computer system! And it will take you less than an hour to do that!

Have you ever thought about speaking at a conference? Have you ever wondered how the speakers managed to get into the conference?

I am afraid of public speaking, I usually speak fast and I’m asthmatic. None of that stopped me to accomplish my dream of sharing knowledge and give to the community as much as I have gotten from the community.

I will share with you how I managed to speak at events across Europe and US, and how thanks to the advice from other speakers and mentors, I manage to overcome my fears and limitations. Hopefully you will leave the session wanting to share your knowledge with others.

Antonio is a Delivery Manager with over 18 years’ experience in the IT industry and specialises in Agile methodologies. He comes from a technical background, starting his career as a Java Developer in Spain in 2000, moving to different roles within IT in three different countries.

Antonio is passionate about creating and implementing the best solution while continually seeking to improve work methodologies. He is convinced that most of the problems in IT are due to lack of communication!

Antonio usually speaks about Agile, DevOps, Project Management and Team management at conferences across Europe and US, such as DevOps Days, JAX, TopConf and Voxxed Days.

Learn about Cooperative Technologists, and the Co-operative movement

The co-operative movement offers a different way viewing the world, based on the values of self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity and solidarity.

Co-operative organisations look to co-operate amongst themselves to effectively build and strengthen the co-operative movement, and they work for the sustainable development of their communities.

There are many similarities between the free software and free culture movements where code and content are freely given back to the community to be remixed, improved and re-engineered.

Come and hear how workers are taking control of technology industry, how you can start a workers co-operative and how you can join a tech workers co-operative.

Matrix is an open standard for communication over the Internet. I will talk about the matrix standard, both the technical implementation and the reasons for its creation. We will focus on the changes and progress that has been made in the previous year, particularly getting the specification out of beta, and the growth of the ecosystem. Finally, the Matrix environment continues to develop, and we'll look at the roadmap for the future.

# Morality and Ethics - Caring is Everything
## Sam Warner[![Twitter Profile for Sam Warner]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/icons/twitter.png){:style="height:20px;width:20px;margin-left:2%"}](https://twitter.com/sjwarner_)<!-- [![FB Profile for SPEAKER]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/icons/facebook.png){:style="height:20px;width:20px;margin-left:2%"}](https://facebook.com/SPEAKER) -->[![LinkedIn Profile for Sam Warner]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/icons/linkedin.png){:style="height:20px;width:20px;margin-left:2%"}](https://linkedin.com/in/samuel-warner/)
![Sam Warner]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/speakers/Sam-Warner.jpg){:style="width:30%"}

In software development, caring is everything.

Of late, we’ve seen a wave of unethical tech plague our industry in ways we’d never thought it could.

Are we just guns-for-hire developers? How do we prevent unethical technology spreading (and being made)?

Spoiler: awareness and diversity are key…

# Error Messages in the wild

I'm interested in error messages that we encounter during our every day life. It used to be that things like billboards and signposts were put up and they'd last until they were posted over. Now billboards are computers - with all the difficulties that computers provide. In my talk I will examine some of the failures that you can encounter in the wild, and some of the issues that error messages displayed to the end user can highlight.

Mike is a software developer now starting to work with NodeJS - having previously been a C# developer.

2018 will be third year where the LUG Frankfurt is cooperating with one of Germany's largest public broadcasters to introduce open source software to children. As part of the highly successful "Show with the Mouse" format (a children's tv show that has been running for the last 46 years), the LUG will host a group of children for a day to learn, use and have fun with open source software.

This talk will give an overview of the general format, discuss our experience with this type of event and also highlight some of the challenges we encountered over the years.
